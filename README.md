Where I mess around with Rust and WGPU in my own time

Other projects not included in this repo:
- [SpaceChunks](https://github.com/DominicMaas/SpaceChunks) Voxel Engine that I orginally wrote in 2014 using OpenGL and SDL.
- [Project Tital](https://github.com/DominicMaas/ProjectTitan) A rewrite of SpaceChunks but in Vulkan (as a learning exercise to understand Vulkan).
- [Project Apollo](https://github.com/DominicMaas/Apollo) Another game of some sorts, never really finished. Ideas used in this project are incoroperated into Vesta.

## Vesta

A light game engine that wraps around WGPU. Is extended when I need new features. Supports 2D and 3D games.

## Example

A very simple example using the Vesta engine. Shows the absolute minimum to render a cube and fly around it using a first person controller.

## Projects/Pixel2D

(Under Development) A pixel simulation game 

## Projects/Eris

(Under Development) A 3D solar system simulation game

## Projects/Titan

(Under Development) A port of project titan / Space Chunks to the vesta engine. Hopefully actually getting things like physics, infinite chunks, and raycasting working.
